# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
### **ðŸš€ Frontend Development Progress (Week 1)**  

This week, I worked on building the **frontend** of a food delivery application using **React (MERN stack)** and **Bootstrap (via CDN)** for styling. Hereâ€™s what has been implemented so far:  

#### **âœ… Login Page**  
- Designed a **responsive login form** with Bootstrap.  
- Added **form validation** for email and password fields.  
- Implemented **redirection to the Admin page** after successful login using `useNavigate()`.  

#### **âœ… Home Page**  
- Created a **hero section** with a gradient background and a call-to-action button.  
- Added **food categories** with images and links to the **menu page**.  
- Designed a **special offers** section using Bootstrap cards.  
- Styled the **Call to Action (CTA)** section with a gradient background.  

#### **âœ… Admin Page & Routing**  
- Fixed **routing issues** to ensure the **Admin page** (`/admin`) is accessible only after login.  
- Used `useNavigate()` for smooth page redirection.  

#### **âœ… Menu Page Enhancements**  
- Expanded the **menu page** with more food items and added **pagination** for better navigation.  
- Implemented a **sidebar with dynamic images** that update based on the selected category (**Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Indian Sweets, Drinks**).  
- Styled the page using **Bootstrap** for a modern and user-friendly UI.  

#### **âœ… General Improvements**  
- Integrated **Font Awesome icons** for better UI elements.  
- Kept **external CSS minimal** to maintain styling consistency.  
- Ensured **smooth navigation** by properly linking pages and improving Bootstrap styling.  

This week focused on **building a fully functional and visually appealing frontend**. The next steps include **UI refinements and backend integration**. ðŸš€
