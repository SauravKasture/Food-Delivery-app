🛠️ One-Week Frontend Development Progress
This week, as part of my internship, I worked on building the frontend of a food delivery application using React (MERN stack) and Bootstrap (via CDN) for styling. Here’s a quick rundown of what I accomplished:

✅ Login Page
Designed a responsive login form with Bootstrap for a clean and modern look.
Added form validation for email and password fields.
Implemented redirection to the Admin page after a successful login using useNavigate().
✅ Home Page
Built a hero section with a gradient background and a call-to-action button.
Created a food categories section with images and links to the menu page.
Designed a special offers section using Bootstrap cards to highlight deals.
Styled the Call to Action (CTA) section with a smooth gradient background for better UI.
✅ Admin Page & Routing
Fixed routing issues to ensure the Admin page (/admin) is accessible only after login.
Used useNavigate() for smooth navigation between pages.
✅ Menu Page Enhancements
Expanded the menu page with more food items and added pagination for easier navigation.
Implemented a sidebar with dynamic images that update based on the selected category (Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Indian Sweets, Drinks).
Styled everything using Bootstrap to maintain a clean and user-friendly UI.
✅ General Improvements
Added Font Awesome icons to enhance the UI.
Kept external CSS minimal to avoid unnecessary global overrides.
Ensured consistent styling across all pages and properly linked everything for smooth navigation.
This week was all about building a visually appealing and fully functional frontend. The next steps will involve fine-tuning the UI and getting ready for backend integration. 🚀
